# Spanish Dict Menu

This (*currently firefox*) extension takes a text selection and sends it to [SpanishDict's](https://www.spanishdict.com/) translator.

## Plans

- Pronunciation
- Phrases
- Menu within to separate via different features, including **conjugation**, **examples**, **pronunciation**, and **phrases**
- Popup upon text selection showing details inline, similar to the [Google Dictionary](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en) extension.
